This directory develops the very basics of category theory.
We're currently aiming for depth, not breadth, as this is primarily an
exercise to discover how hard it is for mathematicians to use Lean.


As notational conventions, we denote
* Categories by capital latin letters near the begining of the alphabet (C, D, E, and then A, B when needed),
* Objects of categories by capital latin letters near the end of the alphabet,
* Morphisms by lower case latin letters,
* Functors by capital latin letters starting at F,
* NaturalTransformations by greek letters.
