* improve proofs for ProductCategory, e.g. use refine?
* type class version of Category
* report bug with class version of Category

* pentagon for lax monoidal category?

* parent field is fake

* AdditiveCategory as an EnrichedCategory, implemented using a type class
giving VObj the structure of an additive group.

* type checking tensor_on_left.onMorphisms

* in (bundled) tensor_on_left, why do we have to write X : Category.Obj C? the
ambiguous overloading is not so ambiguous
